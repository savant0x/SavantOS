# Source-built WINQ-EMU runtime

This recipe builds Try Omarchy's Windows QEMU runtime from the exact QEMU and
virglrenderer fork commits in `sources.lock.json`. It produces:

- `winq-emu-alpha10-portable.zip`, a drop-in replacement for the current runtime
- `winq-emu-alpha10-source.zip`, the corresponding source and build recipe
- `SHA256SUMS`, hashes for both archives

The portable archive includes source provenance, the MSYS2 package inventory,
per-file hashes, and licenses. The Runtime workflow is manual while the output
is being compared with the currently shipped alpha 10 archive on real Windows
hardware.

To build in an MSYS2 UCRT64 shell with the packages in `packages.txt` installed:

```sh
runtime-build/build.sh runtime-output
```

Do not update `guest-build/runtime.lock.json` until the resulting runtime has
passed the Windows test checklist in `docs/RUNTIME-VALIDATION.md`.
